# Object-detection-using-Raspberry-pi
Real-time object detection on Raspberry Pi efficiently identifies and classifies objects using optimized YOLO models. It processes video locally with low latency and no cloud need. Applications include surveillance, robotics, traffic, and assistive tech, all deployed on cost-effective embedded hardware.​
